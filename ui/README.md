google Android Things UI examples
===========

These examples do not require any special hardware, except a monitor/keyboard/mouse attached to the device.  

A note, at the time of testing 5.1preview  toast doesn't show.  These examples are drawn from my UI repo

<a>uiDemo</a>  some basic widgets, buttons, radio butons, edittext, textview.  (form example from ui repo).  There is a alert dialog, instead of toast.  And it used a dark theme on the dialog, in order to see it.

<a>uifragDemo</a> is basic example of using fragments (not suportfragments).

<NavDrawerDemo</a> has the navigation Drawer (from repo ui/Navigation/.  It is a little slow and I won't recommend using it a real app, but it works.  


These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
